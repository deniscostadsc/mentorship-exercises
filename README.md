# Mentorship Exercises

This repository has a few exercises to help people learn programming.

- [2048](./2048.md) - A 2048 implementation
- [lsimple](./lsimple.md) - A simple `ls` implementation
- [urlshortener](./urlshortener.md) - A url shortener service

## Interactions

I recommend to suggest a limited number of steps on each mentorship session.
This will help mentee to implement using SOLID if mentee is not used to SOLID
yet.

I also recommend enforce the use of tests.

After the first steps are finished. mentor must look at the code and give all
feedbacks to improve the code, explaining each point and with good resource to
go deep on that subject.

## Creating new exercises

New exercises must have these sections:

- Goal
- Learning
- Implementation
- Problem extensions
